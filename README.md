# Agentic Math Chrome Extension

A Chrome Extension that solves math problems selected by the user and explains them in simple steps using math.js, optional SymPy server, and Groq LLM.

## Features

The extension combines the accuracy of deterministic math tools with AI-powered explanations to provide:

* 🔢 **Accurate final answers** powered by deterministic math tools.
* 🧠 **Step-by-step one-liners** generated by the LLM, showing how similar problems can be solved.
* ⚡ **Right-click solving**: select any math expression on a webpage and solve instantly.
* 🖥️ **Clean UI**: floating card and popup panel for quick results and copy-paste.

This makes MathMentor not just a solver, but a **learning companion**.

## 🚀 Features

* **Agentic workflow**: Tool handles calculation → LLM explains the method → Extension displays results.
* **Floating card UI**: See results without leaving the page.
* **Context menu integration**: Right-click any math expression and solve it.
* **Popup panel**: Enter custom math expressions directly.
* **Optional SymPy server**: Handle complex symbolic tasks (integration, differentiation, limits, etc.).
* **Concise explanations**: One line per step, always ending with the correct final answer.

## 📂 Project Structure

```

├── manifest.json              # Chrome extension manifest (v3)
├── background.js              # Context menu + messaging
├── background_math_worker.js  # Quick solver + server fallback
├── content_script.js          # Floating UI injection

└── server_example/app.py      # Optional SymPy + Flask server
```

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **User selects a math expression** → Right-click → *Solve with MathMentor*.
2. **Background worker** decides:

   * If simple → solve locally with math.js.
   * If complex → call optional SymPy server.
3. **Final Answer** is returned from the tool.
4. **LLM (Groq)** generates a concise step-by-step method.
5. **Content script** shows both the Answer + Steps in a floating card.

## 📡 Optional SymPy Server

Some expressions (integration, differentiation, limits) are too complex for math.js. For these, you can run the included Flask + SymPy server:

```bash
cd server_example
pip install flask sympy
python app.py
```

By default it runs at `http://localhost:5000/solve`. Update the extension’s config if needed.

## 📘 Example

**Problem:** Differentiate `sin(x)^2` with respect to `x`.

**Tool Answer:** `2*sin(x)*cos(x)`

**LLM Explanation:**

```
Steps:
1. Apply chain rule: derivative of f(x)^2 → 2*f(x)*f'(x).
2. f(x) = sin(x), so f'(x) = cos(x).
3. Substitute back → 2*sin(x)*cos(x).
Final Answer: 2*sin(x)*cos(x)
```

## 🧩 Roadmap

* [ ] Add support for limits, Laplace transforms, series expansions.
* [ ] Integrate notifications (Telegram/Email) for continuous tasks.
* [ ] Web search agent for related examples.
* [ ] Configurable LLM backend (Claude, GPT, etc.).
